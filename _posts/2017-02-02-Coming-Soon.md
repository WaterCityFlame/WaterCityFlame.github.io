Welcome to my blog. How did you find it? WHY did you find it? Nothing links to it, it's on the 5,000th page of Google. Nothing is here yet. 

I'm a computer science student, and my plan for this website is to document my current knowledge and code in the hope that it might be useful to someone, potentially myself. The idea is to post at least once a week and... 

No seriously, why are you reading this?

I just really want to know what you're thinking. This is the fourth paragraph of a blog post that literally says "Nothing is here." Accurately. Go back and read it. I'll wait.

And fine, yes, it says "Nothing is here *yet*," but I wouldn't hold my breath. 

Whatever. Stay tuned for posts on web development, minimum viable git knowledge, and SPACE!!!! described with many exclamation points. Or don't stay tuned. Or wonder what it means to "stay tuned" on a website, isn't that a thing for radios? Do what you want, if you've read this far you're clearly too weird to be questioned or commanded. It'd be nice if you stayed though, weird is nice.
